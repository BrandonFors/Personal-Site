                <p>
                   This is a website I made with a React frontend and Node backend. It allows for someone to keep notes and then delete them
                   when they don't need them anymore. The React client frontend interacts with the Node server backend when a person either adds
                   a note or presses the delete icon. It keeps track of each note component in an array and passes that array to the server 
                   through axios so that the information isn't reset on reload. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   This is a website I made for a school project built with node.js with integrated javascript frontend  (.ejs files) and javascript back end. This website utilizes 
                   APIs to gain data and do different tasks. Originally, this site was supposed to have many different pages with different APIs but I underestimated
                   the time it would take to develop the logic for the Blackjack page and the majority of the complexity went towards that aspect within the index.js file. Please disregaurd
                   the messyness of this file. sAll the pages use ejs files to display content relative to the data passed in. All requests are done using the express npm module within index.js. A lot of the 
                   pages for this website remain unfinished due to running out of time on the project and the styling for this site isn't exactly clean. I haven't gotten around to finishing
                   it and don't know if I will.
                </p>
                <h3>Blackjack Page</h3>
                <p>
                    This page uses a variety of variables that are passed in to display different content based on the state. The Blackjack section contains 
                    a bunch of blackjack logic that is commented and that would take up the majority of this page if I tried to explain it... so I wont. Feel free
                    to check it out on my repository. The link to the site is also below but it is hosted on a page that spins down response time when the page isn't actively
                    used so please be patient.
                </p>

                   This website was created as part of a Catholic Theology class in my highschool. This site is simply html with css styling.
                   It's also loosly inspired by the national geographic website. Check out the repository and website below.
